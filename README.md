### A necessary update to a great theme

I love the color themes and warm tone of Horizon, but it was missing a couple things and semantic highlighting.

Recommended Font: Fira Code w/ ligatures enabled

There is only the main theme and a light theme that is based primarily off of the highlighting colors from the dark theme. The light theme is an attempt at a light theme, but honestly the colors from the dark theme do not lend themselves to the light theme. This may be addressed in a future update.

**Enjoy!**

**This theme is sparsely maintained. I will try to address issues as they come up, but I am not actively developing this theme.*
